(a) Research Title:

"A Mobile Application for Real-Time Detection of Hazardous E-Waste Using Data Science Techniques"

(b) Abstract:

Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally, posing significant risks to environmental and human health. Many of these wastes contain hazardous components such as lead, cadmium, and mercury, which require proper handling and disposal. This research focuses on developing a mobile application that utilizes data science techniques and a TensorFlow Lite model to detect hazardous e-waste in real time. By allowing users to input data or scan e-waste items, the app identifies their toxicity levels and provides recommendations for proper recycling or disposal. The study integrates a lightweight deep learning model to ensure efficiency and compatibility across various mobile devices. This novel approach enhances awareness, promotes safe disposal practices, and contributes to the circular economy by encouraging the reuse of recyclable materials. The findings aim to bridge the gap between technological advancements and sustainable waste management practices, offering a user-friendly and impactful solution to address the global e-waste challenge.

Literature Review:

Electronic waste is a critical issue globally, with reports from the Global E-Waste Monitor 2020 showing that 53.6 million metric tons of e-waste were generated in 2019 alone. Proper handling and disposal remain a challenge due to the toxic nature of components like mercury and cadmium (Forti et al., 2020). Several studies highlight the need for innovative solutions to tackle this growing issue. Cucchiella et al. (2015) emphasized the economic and environmental benefits of recycling e-waste, while Veena and Sreeja (2016) discussed challenges specific to countries like India, including informal recycling practices.

The advent of machine learning has opened new opportunities in waste management. Lu and Xu (2016) reviewed the application of deep learning in automating waste classification, which could significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. Gupta and Singh (2017) explored the role of mobile technologies in monitoring and promoting sustainable waste management practices, suggesting their potential for large-scale adoption. This research builds upon these insights by integrating data science techniques with mobile platforms to detect and manage hazardous e-waste in real-time, offering a scalable and user-friendly solution to this pressing environmental problem.
